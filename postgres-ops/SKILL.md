description: Operational PostgreSQL workflows for production environments — diagnosing slow queries, lock contention, bloat, replication lag, and connection-pool exhaustion; designing and reviewing backups (pg_dump, pg_basebackup, PITR via WAL archiving); planning upgrades and major-version migrations; configuring pgBouncer/RDS Proxy/PgCat; tuning postgresql.conf for OLTP and analytics workloads; writing and reviewing schema migrations across EF Core, Alembic, Flyway, and raw SQL; setting up observability with postgres_exporter to Prometheus, log shipping to Loki, and slow-query alerting; hardening for DoD/federal use (STIG, role separation, RLS, pgaudit, TLS). Use this skill whenever the user mentions Postgres, PostgreSQL, pg_, EXPLAIN ANALYZE, autovacuum, pgBouncer, replication lag, schema migrations, or anything involving a Postgres incident, performance problem, upgrade, backup, or compliance audit — even if they don't say "Postgres" explicitly but the context is clearly a relational database on PostgreSQL. Do NOT use for greenfield CRUD scaffolding — use nextjs-react-postgres-builder for that.

# postgres-ops

Production-grade PostgreSQL operations: diagnosis, performance, HA/DR, security, and observability. Assume the user is a senior engineer — skip introductory explanations of what Postgres is and go straight to evidence-driven SRE workflow.

## When to use

Trigger on operational Postgres tasks:

- **Incident diagnosis**: slow queries, deadlocks, lock waits, runaway autovacuum, connection exhaustion, replication lag, disk pressure, OOMs.
- **Performance review**: `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE)` interpretation, index strategy, partitioning, vacuum/autovacuum tuning, `work_mem` / `shared_buffers` sizing.
- **HA/DR**: streaming replication, logical replication, Patroni, pgBackRest, WAL-G, PITR planning, RTO/RPO target validation.
- **Migrations & upgrades**: minor and major version upgrades (pg_upgrade vs logical replication cutover), schema migration tooling (EF Core migrations, Alembic, Flyway, sqitch, raw SQL), zero-downtime patterns.
- **Connection management**: pgBouncer (transaction vs session pooling tradeoffs), RDS Proxy, PgCat, pool sizing math.
- **Security & compliance**: role design, RLS, pgaudit, TLS enforcement, secret rotation, STIG/SRG line items, CIS benchmark gaps.
- **Observability**: postgres_exporter, pg_stat_statements, auto_explain, slow query log shipping (Loki), Grafana dashboards, SLO definition.

Do NOT trigger for:
- New-feature CRUD scaffolding in Next.js (use `nextjs-react-postgres-builder`).
- Pure SQL-language questions ("what does LATERAL do") with no operational context.
- Other database engines (MySQL, SQL Server, Cosmos DB).

## Instructions

### 1. Diagnose like an SRE

For any incident or performance complaint, follow hypothesis → evidence → fix → verification. Never propose a fix without naming the query you'd run to confirm the diagnosis first.

Default first-look queries:

```sql
-- Active sessions and what they're waiting on
SELECT pid, usename, application_name, state, wait_event_type, wait_event,
       now() - query_start AS runtime, left(query, 200) AS query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state <> 'idle'
ORDER BY runtime DESC NULLS LAST;

-- Blocking chains
SELECT blocked.pid AS blocked_pid, blocked.query AS blocked_query,
       blocking.pid AS blocking_pid, blocking.query AS blocking_query
FROM pg_stat_activity blocked
JOIN pg_stat_activity blocking ON blocking.pid = ANY(pg_blocking_pids(blocked.pid));

-- Top queries by total time (requires pg_stat_statements)
SELECT round(total_exec_time::numeric, 0) AS total_ms,
       calls, round(mean_exec_time::numeric, 2) AS mean_ms,
       round((100 * total_exec_time / sum(total_exec_time) OVER ())::numeric, 1) AS pct,
       left(query, 200) AS query
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC LIMIT 20;

-- Bloat / vacuum status
SELECT schemaname, relname, n_live_tup, n_dead_tup,
       round(100.0 * n_dead_tup / NULLIF(n_live_tup + n_dead_tup, 0), 1) AS dead_pct,
       last_vacuum, last_autovacuum, last_analyze, last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE n_dead_tup > 1000
ORDER BY dead_pct DESC NULLS LAST;

-- Replication lag (on primary)
SELECT client_addr, state, sync_state,
       pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), sent_lsn) AS sent_lag_bytes,
       pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), replay_lsn) AS replay_lag_bytes,
       write_lag, flush_lag, replay_lag
FROM pg_stat_replication;
```

### 2. Read query plans rigorously

When given an `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output:
1. Identify row-estimate vs actual mismatch (>10x = stale stats or bad correlation).
2. Find the dominant cost node (Seq Scan on large table, nested loop with high outer rows, sort spilling to disk).
3. Check buffer numbers — heavy `read=` vs `hit=` indicates cold cache or undersized `shared_buffers`.
4. Recommend: index, query rewrite, statistics target bump, or partitioning — in that order of preference.
5. Always provide the verification command (re-run with same params and compare).

### 3. Migration & upgrade discipline

For schema migrations:
- Always show forward and rollback DDL.
- Flag any `ALTER TABLE` that rewrites the table (changing column type, adding NOT NULL without DEFAULT on PG <11, etc.).
- For zero-downtime: use the expand-contract pattern (add nullable → backfill → enforce → drop).
- For EF Core: use `Add-Migration` + `Script-Migration` to review SQL before apply; never `Update-Database` in prod.

For version upgrades:
- pg_upgrade with `--link` for in-place when downtime is acceptable.
- Logical replication cutover (pglogical or built-in) for near-zero downtime.
- Always confirm extension compatibility on the target version first.

### 4. Connection pooling math

For pgBouncer in transaction-pooling mode:
- `default_pool_size` per (user, database) ≈ `max_connections / number_of_pools` with headroom.
- App-side pool: keep small (5–20 per replica). The pooler is the real concurrency limit.
- Watch out for: prepared statements (need `pgbouncer >= 1.21` with `server_lifetime` tuning), session-level features (`SET LOCAL` only, no `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, no temp tables across txns).

### 5. Federal/DoD posture (when relevant)

- Enforce TLS with `ssl=on`, `ssl_min_protocol_version=TLSv1.2`, restrict `hostssl` only in `pg_hba.conf`.
- `pgaudit` extension for STIG-required audit logging; ship logs to a tamper-resistant store.
- Separate roles: no shared accounts, no `SUPERUSER` for app roles, RLS for tenant isolation.
- FIPS-validated OpenSSL on the host; verify with `SHOW ssl_library;` and OS-level FIPS mode.
- Check the current PostgreSQL STIG (DISA) for line-item compliance — versions ship updates regularly.

### 6. Observability defaults

- Enable `pg_stat_statements`, `auto_explain` (with `log_min_duration_statement` reasonable for prod, e.g., 1000ms).
- Run `postgres_exporter` as a sidecar; scrape into Prometheus.
- Ship CSV logs to Loki via Promtail or Vector; Grafana dashboards keyed on `pg_stat_statements` and `pg_stat_activity`.
- SLO suggestion: P95 query latency for the top-N statements, plus replication lag <N seconds.

### 7. Output discipline

- Give complete, runnable SQL or shell — no placeholders.
- Call out destructive operations explicitly (`DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `pg_upgrade --link`, `vacuum full`).
- For any tuning parameter recommendation, state the workload assumption (OLTP / analytics / mixed) and the math behind it.
- When uncertain about a version-specific behavior, say so and name the version where the behavior changed.

## Anti-patterns

These look like reasonable Postgres moves but will either corrupt data, cause silent failures, or surprise you in production:

1. **Running `VACUUM FULL` on a live high-traffic table** — `VACUUM FULL` acquires an exclusive lock that blocks all reads and writes for the duration. On large tables this means minutes of downtime. Use regular `VACUUM` (autovacuum) for routine bloat; `VACUUM FULL` only on an offline table or during a maintenance window.
2. **Using `UPDATE-Database` in EF Core directly against production** — EF Core's migration runner will execute DDL without the ability to inspect SQL first, and there is no dry-run mode. Always generate a SQL script with `Script-Migration`, review it, then apply through a controlled change window.
3. **Setting `work_mem` globally high** — `work_mem` is per sort operation per query, and a single complex query can trigger many operations simultaneously. Setting `work_mem = 1GB` on a 64 GB server with 100 connections doing complex sorts will OOM the host. Set it low globally and override per session for known heavy queries.
4. **Trusting `pg_dump` without a restore test** — `pg_dump` completing successfully does not mean the backup is usable. Schema dumps with extension version mismatches or missing roles fail silently on restore. Test a full restore to a separate instance on a schedule — not right before you need it.
5. **Using `transaction` pooling mode in pgBouncer with prepared statements** — prepared statements are session-scoped; in transaction pooling the server-side connection changes between transactions, so `PREPARE`/`EXECUTE` will reference a statement that no longer exists. Either use `session` pooling or move to `DEALLOCATE ALL` patterns on every transaction.
6. **Skipping the `--link` caveat with `pg_upgrade`** — `pg_upgrade --link` creates hard links rather than copying data files, making the upgrade fast. But if the old cluster is accessed or the upgrade is rolled back after the new cluster has written to the linked files, data corruption results. Backup before `--link` and never start the old cluster again after the new one has written data.
7. **Adding an index without `CONCURRENTLY` on a production table** — standard `CREATE INDEX` holds a `ShareLock` that blocks writes for the index build duration. `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` avoids the lock but takes longer and cannot run inside a transaction block.
